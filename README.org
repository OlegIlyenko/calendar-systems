* Calendar Systems

** INCOMPLETE
   This project isn't finished right now, it will not work!

** Introduction

   Is a project that concentrates on creating a library for creating
   and using calendar systems. it is mainly targeted on living calendar
   systems. But it's possible to create your own Calendar-systems that
   can be transformed in all other calendar system. We use a reference
   calendar for the transformation, so don't forget to write unit tests
   to check you transforming rules.

** Goals
   1. Creation of Calendar systems that are as correct as possible.
   2. Mapping between calendar systems.
   3. Holiday definition by rules (functions).
   4. All kinds of calendar system craziness  should be possible (for
      example Gregorian calendar, and the Day shift in 1800)
